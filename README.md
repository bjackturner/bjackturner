### About Benjmain Turner
  My name is Benjmain Turner. I am a Junior at Iowa State Universty where I am studying Aerospace Engineering. I am a member of the SAE Aero team at Iowa State. I am on the aerodyamics team of the club. I am hoping to use my time at Iowa State to propel me to a job in the Aerospace field working with military fighter jets. I like going on runs and playing Gutiar. I have been playing some form of insturments for the last ten years.
